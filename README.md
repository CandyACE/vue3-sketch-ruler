- ðŸ’ª Vue 3 Composition API
- ðŸ”¥ Written in TypeScript
# Vue 3 + vite + TS package sketchrule

Because the project was upgraded to vite, I found that the original plug-in Vue sketch ruler would report an error when used in vue3. Here, I repackaged a copy with vite. The packaged plug-in works the same as the original and supports the use in vue3 and vite

---

The original code has been improved and optimized here. The function is the same as that of vue3 sketch ruler before. There is no time for optimization. The main improvements are as follows

1. The eslint repair of vue3 and the code formatting of stylelint and pretty support the use of sketchrule in vue3, and rewrite it to the writing method of vue3 composition API

2. Refactoring with typescript to define types and facilitate subsequent expansion

3. Perform object consolidation calculation for shadow and palette parameters. Previously, palette parameters were either passed or not passed. After improvement, I can only pass the attributes that need to be modified, and those that have not been modified can not be passed

4. Package the type (I don't know the benefits of packaging this type yet)

Due to limited time, we hope to improve the following points in the future:

1. Add the canvas mouse drag function

2. There is a mouse in the lower right corner to enter the zoom function

3. Click the eye in the upper left corner to control the red line development

This is an open source amateur function. If you are interested in strengthening the plug-in, you are welcome to join. You are also welcome to mention PR or issue, or email me a message, 253495832@qq.com

Copy the packaged dist package and import it with import. The following two reference methods are supported

And don't forget to introduce styles

```

import '/dist/style.css'

```
